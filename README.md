🌤️ Weather Dashboard Capstone

A modern and responsive Weather Dashboard built with React, created as the Final Capstone Project for the ALX Front-End Web Development Program.
This application allows users to search for any city in the world and instantly view real-time weather data with a clean UI, smooth animations, and dynamic visual effects based on weather conditions.
